## Conclusion

This technology stack is designed to support the modular architecture of the AI Agenda MCP server. Each technology has been selected based on its ability to fulfill specific requirements while ensuring overall system cohesion. The stack emphasizes developer productivity, system reliability, and maintainability, with a focus on technologies that are well-established in the Node.js ecosystem.

The modular nature of the stack allows for component-level updates and replacements as requirements evolve. For example, the database could be replaced with PostgreSQL if relational capabilities become more important, or the task queue could be migrated to a more robust solution like RabbitMQ if message routing becomes more complex.

By following these technology recommendations, the AI Agenda MCP server will be built on a solid foundation that supports current requirements while allowing for future growth and evolution.
